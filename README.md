# djangoProject
 Django backend
This is a project to practice Django and later I will take it to a frontend project in angular
for future references i will call it "angularProject"


If you want to use this Project pull it and run in terminal python manage.py runserver
make sure to create a MySQL DataBase called 'tutorial' and change in settings.py your username and password.
